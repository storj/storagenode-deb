Description: Storage Node implements piece storing on the Storj network.
    The storage nodeâ€™s role is to store and return data.
    Aside from reliably storing data, nodes should provide network bandwidth and appropriate responsiveness.
    Storage nodes are selected to store data based on various criteria: ping time, latency, throughput, bandwidth, sufficient disk space,
    geographic location, uptime, history of responding accurately to audits, and so forth. In return for their service, nodes are paid.
